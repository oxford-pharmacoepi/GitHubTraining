# Practical session

Go to the <https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopConcepts> and commit a concept set.

- Read the [How to contribute](https://ohdsi.github.io/OmopConcepts/articles/contribute.html) vignette.

- Fork/Clone the repository

- Search for a concept set from a past study that you think it could be useful for others to reuse. In particular consider to contribute with concept sets that can be useful for a table 1 (general conditions or medications) or to calculate the [Charlson Comorbidity index](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/3917/charlson-comorbidity-index-cci).

- Save it in `resources/concept_sets`

- Document with metadata in `resources/metadata.csv` (do not worry about merging conflicts): add brief description, your GitHub user name.

- Add tags if relevant in `resources/tags_metadata.csv`.

- Commit

- Push

- Pull Request

- Do it again :)
